## Introduction

Modern laptops often throttle their performance to manage heat. This can be frustrating, especially during demanding tasks. The **AMD Ryzen Ignore STAPM** project allows you to bypass this throttling mechanism, giving you more control over your device's performance. By focusing on chassis temperature, we aim to keep your laptop running smoothly without unnecessary slowdowns.

## Features

- **Disable Throttling**: Prevents performance drops based on chassis temperature.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple setup and execution process.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and help improve it for everyone.

## Supported Processors

This project supports the following AMD Ryzen processors:

- Ryzen 7 7040U
- Ryzen 7 780M
- Ryzen 7 7840U

If you have a different model, feel free to test it out and let us know your results.
